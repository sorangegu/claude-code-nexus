**Claude Code Nexus** is a high-performance AI proxy service platform deployed on Cloudflare. It's specifically designed for [Claude Code CLI](https://github.com/claude-code/cli), providing a compatibility layer that allows you to seamlessly forward Claude Code requests to **any OpenAI-compatible API service**, such as OneAPI, Azure OpenAI, local Ollama, or any other LLM service that follows the OpenAI specification.

## ‚ú® Core Value

- **üîì Vendor Unlock**: No longer locked to a single AI service provider. You can freely choose the service with the best cost-performance ratio and performance.
- **üîå Seamless Compatibility**: Compatible with Claude Messages API, including streaming responses (SSE), tool use (Tool Use), and multimodal input.
- **üéØ Smart Model Mapping**: Easily configure model mapping rules on the web (e.g., map `claude-3-haiku` to `gpt-4o-mini`), with no changes needed in Claude Code CLI.
- **üîê Secure & Reliable**: API Keys are encrypted and stored in the database, with strict user data isolation.
- **üöÄ Global Acceleration**: Based on Cloudflare's global network, providing low-latency, high-availability access for your AI applications.
- **üåç Open Source & Controllable**: The project is completely open source, allowing you to deploy, modify, and extend it yourself, with complete control over your data and services.

## üöÄ Quick Start (3 Steps)

### 1. Login & Get API Key

Visit **[https://claude.nekro.ai/](https://claude.nekro.ai/)** and log in with your GitHub account. The system will automatically generate a dedicated API Key for you.

### 2. Configure Your Backend Service

In the console, configure your OpenAI-compatible API service. You'll need to provide:

- **Base URL**: Your API service address (e.g., `https://api.oneapi.com`)
- **API Key**: Your API service secret key

### 3. Use in Claude Code

Set the following environment variables in your terminal:

```bash
# 1. Set your dedicated API Key
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="ak-your-nexus-key"

# 2. Set the proxy service address
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL="https://claude.nekro.ai"

# 3. Use Claude Code normally!
claude
```

üéâ **Done!** Now your Claude Code CLI is proxied through Claude Code Nexus, using your own backend service.
